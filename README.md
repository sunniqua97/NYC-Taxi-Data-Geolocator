**NYC-TAXI DATA GEOLOCATOR**

The goal of these programs is to translate longitutde and latitude coordinates of pickup and dropoff locations provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine service into area zones that are used in later years. Translating the coordinates into area zones makes it possible to conduct an analysis of the data more effectively. 

The original data processor that was effective, yet time consuming is listed as the backup processor, while an experimental, quicker algorithm is represeted by te data_processor 2. 

This program was utilized by Hunter College Master's scholar Sara Ahmed for her thesis on "The Impact of Select Buses on Taxi Ridership in NYC."
